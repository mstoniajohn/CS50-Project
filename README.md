# Booklist Storage
## [My Final project for CS50](https://distracted-goldwasser-a8fe4f.netlify.app/)
#### Video Demo:  <https://youtu.be/YAbaKuCEhJo>
#### Description:
This Booklist storage app was made with pure vanilla JavaScript and localStorage for storing data.
This makes the app unique to each user. A user can add books with isbn numbers then retrieve the book by simply going to the website, which loads the book on page load.
